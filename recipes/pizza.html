    <h3>Steps to Make the Dish</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preparation of Dough: </strong>Begin by crafting the perfect
        dough, a delicate balance of flour, water, yeast, salt, and a touch of
        olive oil. Knead the ingredients together until smooth and elastic, then
        allow the dough to rise, developing its characteristic lightness and
        flavor.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Rolling and Shaping: </strong>Once the dough has risen, gently punch it
        down to release excess air and divide it into individual portions. Roll
        each portion into a smooth ball before stretching and shaping it into a
        round disc, ensuring an even thickness throughout.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Sauce and Toppings: </strong>Spread a generous layer of vibrant
        tomato sauce over the prepared pizza base, using a spoon to distribute
        it evenly. Then, let your creativity shine as you adorn the sauce with
        an array of mouthwatering toppings. From classic pepperoni and mushrooms
        to gourmet options like prosciutto and arugula, the possibilities are
        endless.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Baking: </strong>Preheat your oven to a scorching temperature,
        allowing it to reach its maximum potential for the perfect pizza bake.
        Carefully transfer your topped pizza onto a hot pizza stone or baking
        sheet, then slide it into the oven to work its magic. Watch with
        anticipation as the crust crisps, the cheese melts, and the toppings
        meld together in a tantalizing symphony of flavors.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Finishing Touches: </strong>Once your pizza emerges from the oven,
        give it a final flourish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a
        sprinkle of fresh herbs, or a scattering of grated Parmesan cheese.
        Allow the pizza to cool for a moment before slicing it into wedges,
        ready to be enjoyed by eager diners.
